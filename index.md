## Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer passionate about payment systems, open source development, and building reliable enterprise solutions. As one of the core committers to the [jPOS project](https://jpos.org), I spend my days working with payment processing systems and helping teams build robust financial applications.

I believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration. Whether it's contributing code, reviewing pull requests, or helping others solve complex problems, I'm committed to giving back to the community that has given me so much.

## About Me

My journey with jPOS started years ago, and it has become my primary area of expertise. Being a core committer to this project has taught me not just about payments and Java, but about building trust with teams and maintaining critical infrastructure that powers financial systems around the world.

What drives me is solving real problems and helping others succeed. I've been fortunate to work with talented people who trust me with their most challenging technical issues, and that trust is something I value deeply.

Beyond jPOS, I'm interested in all things open source and Java. I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to projects I care about, and connecting with fellow developers who share the same passion for building great software.
