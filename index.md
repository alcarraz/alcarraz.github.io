## Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer passionate about java, open source software, and solving problems.
As one of the top an older contributors to the [jPOS project](https://jpos.org),
I spend my days working with payment processing systems,
knowing the project so deeply and its evolution puts me in a position
to be able to help other build their products or solving they problems.

I believe in the power of open source to drive innovation and collaboration. Whether it's contributing code, reviewing
pull requests, or helping others solve complex problems, I'm committed to giving back to the community that has given me
so much.

## About Me

My journey with jPOS started years ago, and it has become my primary area of expertise.
Being a core committer to this
project has taught me not just about payments and Java, but about building trust with teams and maintaining critical
infrastructure that powers financial systems around the world.

What drives me is solving real world problems and helping others succeed. 
I've been fortunate to work with talented people who
trusted me with their most challenging technical issues, and that trust is something I value deeply.

Beyond jPOS, I'm interested in all things open source and Java. 
I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to
projects I care about, and connecting with fellow developers who share the same passion for building great software.
